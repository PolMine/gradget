# gradget - graph annotation widgets

This is an (experimental) extension of the polmineR-package.

The core functionality is to turn cooccurences-objects generated with
the respective method of the polmineR-package into an igraph object. The
package also contains functions to turn igraph objects into SVG
visualisations, and to generate a three dimensional visualisation based
to three.js.

The package ‘three’ can be installed from GitHub, it is available at:
www.github.com/ablaette/three
